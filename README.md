# Encryption

 Read a sequence of uppercase alphabetic characters from the
console and encrypt it by shifting each character by a fixed number of positions (p)
along the alphabet and restarting from the beginning (letter A) after reaching the end
(letter Z).
For example, let “ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ” be the input character sequence
read from the console, and let the number of positions used for the encryption be 3. The
output will be “DEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZABC”.
If the input contains some non-alphabetical characters or lowercase alphabetical
characters, your program should not change them and just copy them to the output.
